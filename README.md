# R_cytoscape_tutorial

Tutorial on using R to run cytoscape visualizations

There are lots of great ways to make simple networks in R. A non-exhaustive list includes:

- Diagrammer https://github.com/rich-iannone/DiagrammeR
- igraph http://igraph.org/r/
- ggraph (https://github.com/thomasp85/ggraph)


This tutorial is aimed at:

- Cytoscape users interested in running/automating the creation and manipulation of Cytoscape networks using R.
- R users interested in examining more complex networks in an exploratory way 
- R users interested in visualizing networks with metadata.

The tutorial will: 

- Get R and Cytoscape "talking"
- Build a small network in R
- Send the network to Cytoscape
- Give a brief tour of the network in Cytoscape
- Style network visualization using network properties and metadata
